# Text-Encryption-and-Decryption

This project is a simple Java-based tool for encrypting and decrypting text using a custom substitution cipher. The encryption process converts input text into an encoded format based on a user-provided key and a predefined character set, ensuring secure and unique encryption. The corresponding decryption process uses the same key to revert the encoded text back to its original form. Both programs support file handling, allowing users to save encrypted text to a file and read it back for decryption. The tool is interactive, with user-friendly prompts for input text, encryption keys, and file paths. To use the tool, compile and run the Encrypt and Decrypt programs using the Java compiler, and provide the required inputs as prompted. This project is ideal for learning about basic encryption techniques and file operations in Java. It is open-source and can be freely used, modified, and distributed.
